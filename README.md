# MapQaTor Backend

## Project Setup

Follow the step by step installation procedure to install and run this on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have node and postgresql installed in your device.

- **`NodeJs`**: Install Nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **`PostgreSQL`** Install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)


## Installation <a name="configuration"></a>

1.  Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mapqator/mapqator-backend.git
```

2.  If you don't have git installed in your device then download zip
3.  After installation or download go to the repository and open command line.

### Configuring Backend

Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

### Configuring Database

```sh
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE mapqator;"
psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mapqator TO postgres;"
psql -U postgres -d mapqator -a -f schema.sql
```

An empty database will be created with the name `mapqator` and the schema will be created. 
If you plan to host the frontend as well, you need to create an user to login to the website. For that you need to add an entry in the `users` table.

```sh
psql -U postgres -d mapqator -c "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('your_username', '******');"
```

Replace `******` with the hashed password. You can use the following command to generate a hashed password.

```sh
node services\password.js your_password
```

### Setting up the environment variables

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values as per your configuration.

We are finally good to go.

### Run the project

Go to your favourite code editor and run

```sh
npm start
```

You should find that the project is working!
